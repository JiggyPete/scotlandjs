            The age of JavaScript applications is upon us. In this workshop we’ll deep dive into Facebook’s ReactJS, an ambitious web framework that’s taken the community by storm. React takes a different approach to other popular frameworks and in this workshop we’ll explore the benefits of its approaches before spending most of the day harnessing them to create JavaScript applications. We’ll meet and conquer JSX, React’s solution to templating in JavaScript applications, learn how React renders changes and how and when to use props vs state in React.

          <p>
            Along the way we’ll use a variety of tools and libraries to enhance our applications, covering the following throughout the day:
