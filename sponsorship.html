          <h2>Diversity Fund Contribution</h2>
          <p>
            In 2016 we put a huge effort into improving the diversity of the conferences. A large part of that was our diversity programme and also attracting speakers from underrepresented groups, both of which were a huge success. 30% of our attendees and 50% of our CFP speakers were women or non-binary people!
          </p>
          <p>
            All contributions made will go towards:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Poviding free childcare!</li>
            <li>Providing 30 free tickets to people from underrepresented groups for each conference!</li>
            <li>Assisting speakers from underrepresented groups with travel and accommodation.</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
