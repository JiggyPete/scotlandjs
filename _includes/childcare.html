          We know how hard it is for parents to attend events like this while juggling childcare so for the second year we will have onsite childcare during the conference! Please reserve the necessary number of childcare places when purchasing your ticket.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
          The law in Scotland around childcare is very strict to ensure safety and our childcare provider has already performed a full risk assessment.
        </p>
        <p class="text-left">
          If you would like to make use of the childcare facilities we do need to know in advance of the event for staffing purposes so please get in touch.
