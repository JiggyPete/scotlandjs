        <h2>Mobile app development with JavaScript and React Native</h2>
        <h3>Saturday 21st July</h3>
        <p class="text-left">
          Have you ever wanted to develop a mobile app purely in JavaScript? Fed up with sluggish experience of hybrid apps? With React Native you can now get a native mobile app written fully in JS. The best is yet to come. You write code once for both iPhone and Android. Even on your old Linux laptop!
        </p>
        <p>
          This will be very hands on workshop and will cover the following topics:
          <ul>
            <li>How to setup a new project in React Native</li>
            <li>Expo - what it is, how it works and its limitations</li>
            <li>When do you need to eject from Expo</li>
            <li>Navigation options available</li>
            <li>Debugging React Native applications</li>
            <li>How to do animations</li>
            <li>App shipping to Google Play and Apple Store</li>
            <li>Code maintenance, updates and upgrades</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
