          My daughter is only ten years old, but has already been determined enough to teach herself several programming languages and has big dreams of a future career in tech.  As a parent I really want to support her in this and most of all I want her to see and experience from an early age that absolutely, the industry she has chosen is for her.  I want her to meet female computer scientists, engineers and developers, and know that there will be opportunities and space for her in the industry too.
        </p>

        <p>
          <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> was one of the first tech events Iâ€™d come across that actively encouraged and offered support to people that wouldnâ€™t otherwise attend.  Entry fees and travel costs are a real barrier to access for those from low income households, people just starting out and those not yet in paid employment in the industry. Also running hands-on workshops during the weekend part of a conference is really helpful as it means people who most benefit are able to attend.
        </p>

        <p>
          It was very clear to me that a huge amount of work had been done to make <a href="/">ScotlandJS</a> an attractive and safe event for women, LGBTI, people of colour, parents and other minorities to speak at or attend.
        </p>

        <p>
          Girls like my daughter are very much the future of the industry, and my hope is that more companies will commit to, and follow the example of <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> in being welcoming and inclusive, and offering as much support as possible to young women and parents within the developer community.

          Hello everyone my name is Connie and I love coding, Professor Snape and waffles. I began teaching myself to code when I was about 6 because I played lots of video games like Minecraft and Terraria and I wanted to learn how to make my own.  I got some books from the library and first I learnt Python (which is awesome), then HTML, CSS and JavaScript (awesome and amazing!).  As soon as I heard about <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> I wished so much that I could go but didnâ€™t think I would be able to because a lot of conferences and workshops are only for business people.  I code every day and I want to become a developer with my own company one day too.  When <a href="https://twitter.com/jiggy_pete" target="_blank">Peter</a> the organiser found out that I might not be able to get to Scotland JS he told my mum about the diversity tickets and he did everything to help me be part of it. (YAY!).  <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> was my first ever conference and I loved it so much! It made me feel really happy to join. Everyone there was really nice and welcoming, and there were beginners there too - just like me.  <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> was held in Edinburgh, which I had never been to before, it is an amazing city with beautiful mountains and scenery. The actual conference was held at Dynamic Earth Building, it has a huge mountain called Arthurs Seat behind it. When I arrived at Dynamic Earth I got my <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> lanyard and a cool sticker to put on my laptop.

            There were talks and presentations downstairs in the auditorium and tea and snacks upstairs.  The talks were all really interesting and fun and I learnt a lot from them all.  I learnt about the npm package journey and how it gets to your computer when you type npm install in the terminal.  Before I went to <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> I knew how to use npm, but not all the magic behind the scenes ðŸ§™.  I also like ES6 a bit more now, because of a talk on Tamagotchis!  And I really enjoyed a fun talk about how JavaScript does Maths, because I really like Maths, and I learnt some cool new tips.

            Listening to the talks gave me so many new ideas.  I got started on a few of them right away and I even managed to make a game in JavaScript while I was listening to the talks.
          </p>


          <p>
            At break time I invited people to join me to do some hacking and it was so awesome to work on a challenge together.
          </p>

          <p>
            I really would like to go to more conferences because I met people from all around the world and made friends that I can keep in touch with to talk about coding and keep learning together.  I had loads of fun.  I even showed some people how to floss!

            At <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> they had something called <a href="http://weareupfront.com/" target="_blank">On Stage</a>, which is where you can get the chance to sit on stage during a talk and see what itâ€™s like to be a speaker! I was asked by <a href="https://twitter.com/jiggy_pete" target="_blank">Peter</a> if Iâ€™d like to give it a go and after thinking about it for a few days, I said yes.  It really wasnâ€™t as scary as I thought and anyone can give it a go.

            Iâ€™m really glad that I did it because after I went to <a href="/">Scotland JS</a>, it made me want to do my own talk.  And I actually did it the very next week! I prepared my very first talk all about my time at <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> and why everyone especially girls like me who love coding, should go to a conference.  I presented it at my local girls coding group and I think it went really well.
          </p>

          <p>
             Another cool thing I learnt at <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> was how to use React Native! I took part in a workshop and learnt how to make an app and I made a tutorial about it for my friends to try when I got home.  For my next steps, Iâ€™m going to create a blog about some of the projects Iâ€™ve been working on and I hope I can do another talk in the future too.
          </p>

          <p>
            I really want to say a big thank you to all of the <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> family for being so awesome and especially <a href="https://twitter.com/jiggy_pete" target="_blank">Peter</a> for making sure I had the chance to get involved and give everything a try. Itâ€™s really helped me on my coding journey and given me even bigger dreams that I know I can achieve if just keep coding. ðŸ˜Š <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> Forever!
