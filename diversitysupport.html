      <p>ScotlandJS and ScotlandCSS conferences have existed as a self-sufficient event for a number of years. As a separate initiative, this year we are looking to support underrepresented groups with tickets, and further financial support.</p>
      <p>We have been working for years to improve the gender balance of our conferences, particularly around speakers. This year we have 5 non-white male speakers of 7 already lined up and are hoping this encourages more to apply. We have already organised and ran support groups, chaired by non-white men in 5 cities across 4 countries to support members of the community and encourage them to give their first talk.</p>
      <p>We are looking to make 30 tickets available to ScotlandJS and 30 for ScotlandCSS, our two conferences running back to back from June 1st-3rd. We are also looking to provide support for speakers from underrepresented groups, to cover transport, accommodation and other relevant associated costs.</p>
      <p>We would like to make it clear that ScotlandJS and ScotlandCSS are run on a break even policy and are self-sufficient. Nobody makes any financial gains from putting together these events. The conferences will sell out to 250 attendees but we want to reach out to and support those from underrepresented groups and encourage them to attend. </p>
      <p>To do that we need your assistance to help grown a more inclusive, positive and diverse development community.</p>
      <p>Please get in touch if you would like to support us.</p>
