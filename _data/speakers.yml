She has somehow survived to enjoy writing software even more than she did back then, and she suspects she might have learned some useful things about how to do it during that time. Her current position as VP of Engineering at npm, Inc, is her favorite job ever. She gets to run the npm registry and the amazing tiny team that keeps the packages flowing.<br/></br>Her favorite member of One Direction is Brian Eno.'
