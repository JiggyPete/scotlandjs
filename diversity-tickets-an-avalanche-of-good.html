          Hi! I’m <a href="https://twitter.com/lost_semicolon" target="_blank">Ewa</a>! I am a software developer ( I was a microbiologist before, in what seems like another life) and this summer I have received one of thirty diversity tickets to attend <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> in 2018.

            It is definitely true that you are reading this because thousands of people worked on the technology that allows you to do so: the creators of the internet and the wide web, the developers who wrote the framework and browsers plugins, and the designers who crafted the user experience - just so that this article could reach you. Isn’t that amazing?
          </p>

          <p>
            Let’s quickly name some of the people that come to mind when we think about the tools and technologies we use every day. We have that guy Tim Berners-Lee who invented WWW, and Steve Jobs and Bill Gates who did the cool hardware and software things. The first email was invented by Ray Tomlinson, and Facebook was created by Mark Zuckerberg. And before Facebook, many of us would check in daily on MySpace with Tom Anderson.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some great guys there, huh? But they have more in common than technical brilliance and creative insight: they share specific set of characteristics (such as ethnicity, gender, and access to education) that afforded them opportunities.  Often though, people are denied such opportunities based on the lack of those specific characteristics.
          </p>

          <p>
            Is that changing now? Well.... Not really.  BCS report stated that in the UK only 10% of females are tech directors. And just 17% of IT specialists were female, 8% were disabled, 21% were from older age groups and 17% were from ethnic minorities. The document does not highlight females from ethnic minorities but i would suspect it is very small.
            There are of course many reasons for this and this is an incredibly complex topic because, we as people, are complex as well.
          </p>

          <p>
            What's worse is that we also know that women are leaving the industry  - I couldn't not find data on UK population but <a href="https://www.ncwit.org/sites/default/files/resources/womenintech_facts_fullreport_05132016.pdf" target="_blank">ncwit report</a> states that quit rate is more than twice as high for women as it is for men. And the major feature of the report is that “Workplace experiences emerge as one of the most significant differences between women who stay in computing and those who leave” and continues to state that “Women who left were less likely to report opportunities for training and development, support from a manager, and support for balancing work and other competing responsibilities. They were also more likely to report undermining behavior from managers. “
            And even worse, “men four times more likely than women to say that they don’t see discrimination happening”.
          </p>

          <p>
            So you see, my industry which is full of design, innovation and laptop stickers is also is full of obstacles which make it harder for me to find my place in the workplace and excel in what I do. But not all hope is lost.

            In the attempt to even out the playing field many tech conferences now offer something called Diversity tickets - these tickets are aimed at supporting underrepresented groups in the tech industry. Essentially, they are free ticket to a conference which will allow the attendee to learn and make connections. And sometimes, when conferences are trying to diversify their attendee list, they also create environments in which people feel comfortable in and so they keep returning.

            So for me, <a href="/">ScotlandJS</a> did just that. I received a diversity ticket to attend the conference (organised by <a href="https://twitter.com/@jiggy_pete" target="_blank">Peter</a>), through <a href="https://www.meetup.com/Ladies-of-Code-Glasgow/" target="_blank">Ladies of Code Glasgow</a> (organiser <a href="https://twitter.com/@crgrieve" target="_blank">Carole Logan</a>) and was super excited to get the ticket - this was a fantastic opportunity for me, as a junior dev, to learn about the subject which I knew very little about and upskill myself. And to be quite honest, that ticket was a start of an avalanche for change over the next couple of months.
          </p>

          <p>
            I went to a hackathon with some people that were more senior and they all were very JS savy which helped me to prepare a bit for the conference. I kept contributing after ( although it was more python)  and I started looking at front end web development as a whole and looking as JS itself. The conference drew near, I had done some small projects and reading to learn the basics so I would understand a bit more about what was going on. I was able to talk to my peers about silly things I have done ( like my Heard of Sheep site which plays different sheep baas when keyboard keys are pressed), and drew attention of some other people who invited me to a conference.
          </p>


          <p>
            When I attended the conference I was actually interviewing for a new job. They were impressed with what I was learning and that I wanted to learn. I know they took a bit of a gamble on me based on my current skill level but I know now that I will get to the standard they expect in no time. At the conference, I was able to meet with people from all over the world, learned a tonne and was able to use it pretty much straight away (like chrome dev tools talk from <a href="https://twitter.com/@LoraVardarova" target="_blank">Lora Vardarova</a>). It was really great - I felt welcomed and strived in the environment. I am incredibly grateful for the opportunity I was given through the diversity ticket and it benefited me greatly.
          </p>


          <p>
            But I believe there is another side to this diversity ticket story.
          </p>


          <p>
            The thing is, I wasn’t always as aware of diversity issues I am today -  It took time, many embarrassing moments and curiosity for me to learn. And what I imagine is that for majority for people, it is the same. I believe that when people come to a conference which offers diversity tickets, often attendees are exposed to a different environment which they might not be used to in the office. They are shown that there can be a better way of treating each other and that we all just here to do cool things. In <a href="/">Scotland JS</a> example, there was a clear message that bullying of any kind would not be tolerated. We saw diverse groups in the position of knowledge through speakers and attendees. We were educated on our privilege through <a href="https://twitter.com/@kimcrayton1" target="_blank">Kim Craytons’ </a>talk. Experiences and tips were shared across the board on how to make the technology and our environments better - wrapped in an easy, fun and informative way. Essentially -  People saw the amazing thing which tech can be, and should be. Hopefully this causes people to come back to their base and share their experiences with others - to appreciate and support diversity in the workplace.
          </p>


          <p>
            So diversity tickets not only benefit the person receiving the ticket. They benefit all attendees and beyond.
And this is why diversity tickets create an avalanche of change for good.
