      Zendesk was started in a Copenhagen loft by three friends who used an old kitchen door as a desk. They wanted to bring a bit of zen to the chaotic world of customer support. And they wanted to do it with software that was nice to look at and easy to use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since then, the company has grown. The software is now built all over the world, by a growing group of talented, charming people. The offices are bigger and we have real desks, but we've held on to the spirit with which we began: be genuine, listen to customers, and keep it beautifully simple.
